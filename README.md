# intersect.ts [![Node.js Package](https://github.com/lirannl/Intersect.ts/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lirannl/Intersect.ts/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml)
A Typescript package made to programatically intersect an arbitrary number of types, and a partial intersection type.
Supports types which are normally incompatible thanks to a discriminant property.
